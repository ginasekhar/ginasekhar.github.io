This is a quote by Benjamin Franklin.  As I finish my final project at the Flatiron School, I see how much this quote applies to me.  Throughout the course, there were lessons to read, instructional videos to watch, labs to do, study groups and portfolio projects to complete.  Reading the lessons and watching the instructional videos laid out basic information on the topic.  As I worked on the labs, I would look back at the lesson and try to replicate the pattern (sometimes not fully understanding the material). 

The study group sessions brought a little more clarity on the subject. We were fortunate that our cohort lead was very thorough and was willing to spend extra time to walk us through the topics in the lessons. It gave us the opportunity to ask questions and clear up any doubts we had. 

But the portfolio project is what really gives us a deeper understanding of the subject. When we try to create a project from scratch instead of just following the pattern laid out in the lessons, or labs, we are forced to look at the big picture.  We have to execute every phase of application development - design, code, test and debug our project. The debugging especially pushed me.  Upon encountering errors, I had to pay attention to the details, retrace steps and figure out what I needed to do differently. Sometimes I even had to go back to the drawing board.  All these activities resulted in better comprehension of the material. 

In this program, we were provided all three aspects of learning–the “tell me” was the lessons and labs, the “teach me” was the study group sessions, and the “involve me” was the portfolio project. Each of these aspects contributed to a holistic learning process.
