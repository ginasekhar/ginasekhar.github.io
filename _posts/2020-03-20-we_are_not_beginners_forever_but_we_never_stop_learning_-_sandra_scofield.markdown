As our cohort prepares to graduate, we also realize that this bootcamp was just one step in our quest to learn.  

As we went through the curriculum, I often looked to external resources for additional information to enhance my understanding and comprehension of the subject matter.  

From articles and blogs to video tutorials, there was an abundance of information for the taking.  

I found several YouTube channels dedicated to web development tutorials.  *Mosh Hamedani's* **Programming with Mosh** channel, *Brad Traversy's* **Traversy Media** channel, Steven Grider's RallyCoding channel, *Steve Griffith's*  channel are just some of the resources available.  If you search on YouTube for any topic that you want to explore deeper, you will find a plethora of videos explaining that topic.  

My very favorite resource was **Scrimba**.  The React course on Scrimba really helped me understand the concepts in React in a way that just the curriculum would not have. 

In addition, there are numerous courses on **Udemy**.  Along the way, I have actually used a lot of these resources; there were many more that I wanted to go back to when I had more time. I've already signed up for more courses on Udemy to take my learning further. 

We have just started on our journey.  There are so many resources to continue this quest to learn.
